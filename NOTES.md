# Notes

- For all tasks, I assumed that input lists may contain invalid or unexpected values, and designed the functions to skip them safely.  
- Task 2 uses simple structural checks for emails rather than full RFC validation to keep it practical for the assignment.  
- In Task 1 and Task 3, division by zero is avoided by returning 0.0 if no valid items exist.  
- Alternative approaches like raising exceptions or using regex were considered but not implemented to keep the solutions simple, readable, and robust.
